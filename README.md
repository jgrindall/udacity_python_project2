A README file is included in the project root and includes:

an overview of the project.
instructions for setting up and running the program.
a brief description of the roles-and-responsibilities of all sub-modules including dependencies and examples of how to use the module.

Define custom exception classes for different types of exceptionsâ€”for things like *Invalid File, Invalid Text Input (e.g. too long)
